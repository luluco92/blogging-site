First run db/schema.sql in MySQL to create a database. Then install the npm packages by typing 'npm i' in the console after you have navigated to the program's directory. Finally run 'node server.js' and the website will be ready to go on your MySQL server.

## Usage Information

Lucky Blog is a blogging site with a database of users, blogs, and comments. Users can create blogs, and write comments on blogs. You can also edit your blogs or delete them. There is also the possiblity that you can edit/delete other users' blogs, but let's not talk about that right now.

## Testing Instructions

Try testing out whether you actually can edit other users' blogs. Then tell me so that I can try to fix it.
